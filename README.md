# DataBinding_NetCore
a demo about the view model binding in Net Core

This code is linked to my blog post about how to create data binding in net core mvc. I will publish my post soon and add the address to here.

This demo shows how to create model, view and controller to submit a register form to back end with annotation and validation. Pure C#ã€€MVC without JS.
